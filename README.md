**Set up a virtual lab and pentest major AWS services, including EC2, S3, Lambda, and CloudFormation**

## What is this book about?
The cloud is taking over the IT industry. Any organization housing a large amount of data or a large infrastructure has started moving cloud-ward and AWS rules the roost when it comes to cloud service providers, with its closest competitor having less than half of its market share. This highlights the importance of security on the cloud, especially on AWS. While a lot has been said (and written) about how cloud environments can be secured, performing external security assessments in the form of pentests on AWS is still seen as a dark art.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Familiarize yourself with and pentest the most common external-facing AWS services 
Audit your own infrastructure and identify flaws, weaknesses, and loopholes 
Demonstrate the process of lateral and vertical movement through a partially compromised AWS account 
Maintain stealth and persistence within a compromised AWS account 
Master a hands-on approach to pentesting 
Discover a number of automated tools to ease the process of continuously assessing and improving the security stance of an AWS infrastructure
